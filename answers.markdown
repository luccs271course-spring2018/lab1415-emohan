<h3>Discuss the differences among the results.</h3>
 
BreadthFirst and Closest have the same order resulting iteration sequence, only differnce being the stack and queue. 
Depth has the opposite of breadth. With random the resulting iteration sequence yielded is unique each time.

<h3>Does the starting point make a difference?</h3>
starting point does matter.

<h3>Using JGraphT's GreedyColoring or other coloring algorithm, find out how many colors are required to color your map in 
such a way that no two adjacent countries have the same color. That is, generate and print the coloring. 
Fun fact: For any idealized map (planar graph), this requires at most four colors.</h3>

Four colors are required to color the map in our case. Coloring:
Coloring [number-of-colors=4,

<h3>Give two or three examples of how/why a real-world map might require more than four colors.</h3>
A real world example would be the countries, but then also the two places in that country, like the most populous cities, 
tourist attractions, etc, which would reguire more than 4 colors. 
Another example is the disconnected regions of countries would have to utlize more than four colors.
